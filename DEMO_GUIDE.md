## 🌟 Key Demo Features

### 1. **Terrain-Based Pothole Detection** 🗺️

**What Makes It Special:**

- AI detections are correlated with **terrain analysis**
- Each detection includes:
  - Elevation data
  - Road surface roughness
  - Drainage score
  - Slope analysis
  - **Risk score** (0-100)

**How to Demo:**

1. Go to **Map Dashboard**
2. Click **"🗺️ Terrain Risk"** button (bottom left)
3. **Color-coded heatmap** appears:

3. 🎯 **Interactive elements**: Let audience suggestions guide navigation
4. 🎯 **Emphasize uniqueness**: Terrain-based prediction, not just detection
5. 🎯 **Keep it flowing**: Practice transitions between features

### **Handling Questions:**

**Q: "How accurate is the AI detection?"**
_A: "Our YOLOv5 models achieve 75-98% confidence. The demo shows realistic confidence scores based on detection difficulty and terrain type."_

**Q: "Does this work in real-time?"**
_A: "Yes! The system processes video streams in real-time. The demo uses pre-generated data, but live detection is available via webcam or uploaded videos."_

**Q: "What about API costs?"**
_A: "Zero! We use 100% free and open-source technologies - OpenStreetMap, Leaflet, CesiumJS, and OSRM. No vendor lock-in, no surprise bills."_
